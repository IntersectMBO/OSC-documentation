# ðŸ¤© Open Source Strategy

As Cardanoâ€™s journey in the Voltaire era continues, the Open Source Committeeâ€™s strategy empowers community-led and sustainability-driven decisions, shaping our path forward in open source development.

## **General Context**

The scope of this document is to present the Open Source Committee Cardano strategy. This strategy proposal is mainly defined by our strong commitment to a community-led and decentralized approach. The mission is clear: to support Cardano's journey in the open-source world, ensuring it remains both stable and secure.&#x20;

As Cardanoâ€™s journey in the Voltaire era continues, the Open Source Committeeâ€™s strategy empowers community-led and sustainability-driven decisions, shaping our path forward in open source development

The strategy for Cardanoâ€™s open-source development has been shaped through a collaborative effort, involving a diverse group of stakeholders. Starting with fundamental questions about our identity and who we serve, we established a clear mission, vision, and values that guided the next steps, and the more granular elements. This has been a deliberate, step-by-step process to ensure that the strategic objectives we set are not only a reflection of our collective ambitions but also actionable and measurable.

More details about the methodology used and the foundational model in the Appendix A.

## Summary

We envision Core Cardano as a project mainly defined by its technological excellence, driven by an inclusive community. Improving technical sustainability, governance, and deepening community engagement â€” these are the strategic pillars that sit in the middle of the structure and will guide our actions and goals for the current development stage.&#x20;

For example, by the end of 2024, we aim to complete a comprehensive audit of Intersect-maintained Cardano projects, according to a Project Lifecycle Framework. This initiative, alongside our commitment to diversified funding models and diversifying maintainers group, set the ground for positioning Cardano as a model of open-source execution.

The diagram below illustrates our strategy development process. From the core mission and vision, we have identified strategic pillars that are crucial to our success. They have been broken down into specific goals, supported by detailed actions that outline how we will accomplish them.

The strategic approach embedded in this framework is designed to be iterative, a living model open to constant refinement. It supports a dynamic strategy concept, where all our thinking and actions continuously evolve according to the market changes, maturity stages, and the needs of the Cardano community. That way we ensure our trajectory is both responsive and resilient.

## Strategy elements

### Mission

We enable the successful development and evolution of Cardano as a community-led, decentralized open source project

Our mission is to support the growth of Cardano into a community-driven, decentralized open-source project. We are committed to providing tools, policies and support for its success, ensuring it remains adaptable and accessible.&#x20;

### Vision

We envision a future where the Cardano project is strongly led by a thriving community, and its open development is not dominated by any single entity.

We want to see Cardano evolving in open-source mature initiative, driven by a strong and diverse community. We foresee a future where the project is known for both its technological excellence and its democratic, inclusive development process. Cardano will exemplify a decentralized but stable ecosystem where every contributor plays its part.&#x20;

### Core Values

#### **Openness**

We believe and promote transparent collaboration, accessibility, flexibility, and community-driven governance, fostering trust, inclusivity, and innovation in the Cardano Open Source Project (COSP).

#### **Legitimacy**

COSP is more than a collection of GitHub repositories - it is the source code for the binaries that are deployed onto the real Cardano mainnet. It is therefore of the utmost importance to maintain the legitimacy of the COSP.

#### **Citizenship**

We are committed to be an exemplary Open Source citizen, actively contributing to the broader ecosystem and setting a standard in the open-source world.

#### **Quality**

We maintain the security and health of the Cardano mainnet. We are fully committed to high quality, both in decision-making and in writing software.

#### **Sustainability**

We acknowledge the necessity for ongoing development of the COSP, aiming to prevent stagnation and ensure the Cardano network's continued growth and dynamism.

### Strategic Pillars

#### Technical Sustainability

Ensuring Core Cardano maintains its reputation for being robust, secure, and open, while continuously adapting to new technological developments and environmental changes.

#### Governance and Decision-Making

We follow a transparent, inclusive, and effective governance model that empowers the Cardano community to actively participate in the decision making process.&#x20;

#### Community Engagement and Collaboration

We focus on contribution diversity, especially among maintainers, establish communication channels for collaboration, and empower community-led projects.

## Goals & Actions

#### Goal 1 - By Q4, 2024, all Intersect-maintained Cardano projects will have been audited and made decisions, based on the Project Lifecycle Framework, about their sustainability, risk mitigation strategy, and possible post-mortem actions (if applicable).

#### Metrics:

* 100% of the projects will audited
* 50% of projects will have a diversified funding model

#### Actions:

1. Establish the project lifecycle framework\
   This framework will include guidelines for project stages, key milestones, success metrics, risk indicators, intervention strategies, and post-mortem actions. Also a plan for continuously monitoring projects.
2. Evaluate projects according to the Lifecycle Framework\
   Through this assessment we want to understand projectsâ€™ current phase, health, and sustainability.&#x20;
3. Implement project support items\
   Project support actions will be established in association with framework and escalations for project health identified by assessment

#### Goal 2 - By Q4 2024 70% of Intersect-maintained projects will be aligned with the published Intersect Project Governance Policy by using open communications channels for discussions and meetings.

#### Metric:

* No of projects meeting the criteria â†’ 70%

#### Actions:

1. Stabilize the Governance Policy\
   Weâ€™ll conclude pilot testing the implementation of the Governance Policy, ensuring it's clear, comprehensive, and ready to be fully deployed across projects
2. Work with projects to help them implement the Governance Policy\
   Assist Intersect-maintained projects in adopting and integrating the governance policy, providing support for seamless implementation
3. Monitor implementation progress\
   Track and assess the adoption rate and application of the governance policy across projects, identifying areas of improvement&#x20;

#### G3 - By the end of 2024, 50% of Intersect-maintained Cardano projects will be supported by paid maintainers from at least two companies.&#x20;

Strategy: Weâ€™ll prioritize contracted maintainers from other organizations to ensure project diversity and sustained contribution. Weâ€™ll utilize and promote existing tooling and internal resources to support their involvement.

#### Metric:

* % of projects supported by paid maintainers from at least two companies â†’ 50%

#### Actions:

1. Define the Pathway to Maintainership â†’ what is a maintainer\
   Outline criteria and steps for becoming a maintainer, detailing the responsibilities, skills, and commitment required. This initiative will establish a transparent process for onboarding new maintainers, ensuring clarity on the role and expectations.
2. Engage past collaborators, identify possible maintainers\
   Conduct a survey among core Cardano project teams to identify companies and professionals they've successfully collaborated with in the past. Compile a list of potential maintainers with proven track of records.
3. Engage TSC\
   Present a formal request to the TSC, emphasizing the strategic importance of diversifying project maintainers&#x20;
4. Facilitate maintenance engagements\
   Initiate a matchmaking process between core Cardano projects and potential maintainers identified in action # 1

2. Implement a security issue reporting process\
   Establish a process for the community to report security vulnerabilities, and outline steps for response / resolution by teams
3. Adoption of the security policy to Intersect-maintained Cardano projects\
   Ensure that all Intersect-maintained Cardano projects incorporate and follow the newly developed standardized security policies

## Conclusions

As a conclusion, we consider the strategy plan for Intersect-maintained Cardano projects well aligned with our mission, vision, core values and the pillars of Technical Sustainability, Governance and Decision-Making, and Community Engagement and Collaboration. The emerged goals and their associated actions are designed to set the ground for long-term success of these projects in the context of a diverse, transparent, and collaborative ecosystem.

By implementing the Project Lifecycle Framework and conducting comprehensive audits, Intersect OSC aims to ensure that all maintained projects are properly identified into a lifecycle scale, where support and sustainability measures can be taken to ensure the project's success.. This proactive approach to risk mitigation and sustainability planning will help maintain Cardano's reputation for technical excellence.

The focus on aligning projects with the Governance Policy and establishing open communication channels shows a strong commitment to a transparent and inclusive governance. By empowering the Cardano community to actively participate in decision-making processes, Intersectâ€™s OSC empowers ownership and collaboration among stakeholders.

At the same time, diversifying project maintainers and encouraging paid contributions from multiple companies ensures the long-term health and resilience of the Cardano ecosystem. By that, OSC actively promotes contribution diversity and reduces reliance on any single entity.

In conclusion, the successful execution of this strategic plan will position Intersect-maintained Cardano projects for long-term success, and reinforcing its core values. The well defined metrics and actions associated with each goal enable OSC to track progress and make data-driven decisions to ensure the continuous growth and resilience of the Cardano ecosystem.

## Appendix A - Strategy Framework

This is the model we used to plan, draft, revise and create the strategy plan presented above. We include it here as a reference for future improvements, and being sure that the next iterations will remain aligned with some core principles.

## What is strategy

Simply put, strategy is flying high to advance forward effectively.

Strategy is a feature of any initiative that gives to participants and contributors a high level understanding of what and why they do what they do.

There could be (and usually are) multiple layers of strategy. If the organization (or the initiative) is big and complex, we can deal with a layered or hierarchical strategy.

For example, there is an overarching strategy for Cardano that describes its long term aim, and how it will transform the world - creating a secure, transparent, and fair global society. OSC and Intersect contribute to this big and inspiring goal, but they will set their own strategy for their contribution.

For this reason, oneâ€™s tactic could be another's strategy. In the example above, transitioning in the Voltaire era is a tactical initiative for Cardano's vision of creating a secure, transparent, and fair global society but it will be defined as a strategy for Intersect-MBO and its Open-Source initiative. In fact, even for Intersect, OS itâ€™s a solution, a tactical approach - How can we be successful in open source? By operationalizing an OS Office.

Always, the layered strategies are connected - top strategies determine the shape of lower positioned strategies. For this reason, itâ€™s important to start on top, and continue downstream.&#x20;

Here are some key elements of a solid and efficient strategy:

* Layered or hierarchical
* Defined top-down (for a portfolio or an complex org)
* Flexible&#x20;
* Vertical (its elements vertical organized)
* Long term focused
* Well communicated
* Monitored
* Evaluated (constantly)
* Supported by tools

## What isnâ€™t strategy

Strategy isnâ€™t the how. Strategy ends when the how starts.

A good strategy describes the final destination, possible paths to get there, why we want to reach that point, but it doesn't describe how weâ€™ll travel - by plane, by train, etc. Those types of decisions will be taken considering how much time we have, budget, intermediate sightseeings we want to reach along the way, terrain (is there any big ocean to cross, mountains, etc).

\
Most of the time strategy is mixed, or confused with tactical planning: roadmaps, gantt charts, etc. For sure, a strategy could include timeframes, SMART goals, and some general planning. But those things are generally defined using a zooming out device, not a magnifier lens.

## Cardanoâ€™s strategy vs OS strategy

As was stated above, in complex or big organizations, ecosystems or portfolios could be the case when an entity's strategy drives / influences / determines another entityâ€™s strategy. As Intersect-MBO, OSC and OSO exist to implement Cardanoâ€™s vision about an open world and blockchain society, everything in Open-Source strategy is highly connected to Cardanoâ€™s strategic approach. â†’ Itâ€™s connected, but it isnâ€™t the same.

So, everything about how Cardano will live and flourish in the open source world is an iteration with more specific elements of Cardanoâ€™s own strategy.

To conclude:

* OS strategy != Cardano strategy
* Cardano strategy â‡’ OS strategy

## Strategy toolset - frameworks and principles

If everything is valid in the section above, then we can state some axioms about defining OSO strategy:

* OS strategy derives from Cardanoâ€™s strategy
* OS strategy implements Cardanoâ€™s strategy
* OS strategy has all elements of a strategy and lives by its own. It follows the general best practices of a strategy.
* OS strategy is a living entity - itâ€™s flexible and can be adapted according to the market and community feedback
* OS strategy is constantly monitored
* OS strategy is constantly communicated

## OS Strategy - foundational model

Here it is the foundational model used to define Intersect Open-Source Strategy

Few considerations before diving in more details, and explaining each element:

* Start at the bottom. A solid house needs a solid foundation â†’ donâ€™t build the roof before having the foundation and the ground set.

<figure><img src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/yndiDL9FG1c2HxUs-9oZtiUyIlHSN9PLDdJlhPzBmcApwHvidGcu3mebfsiDzNUoIU_n8YP4T1beeC1pLW6XRau6N4t2IjU2gccy9Xt6rprv6KAgnAKKRn6q3snQBF-xcX72kHreUMvF5jnN9KzeyKw" alt=""><figcaption><p>Strategy Foundation Model</p></figcaption></figure>

* Have quality nuts and bolts on hand - the structure needs to be glued together&#x20;
* Pillars emerge from the foundation. They are strong and flexible, like reinforced concrete.
* Everything above stays on top of that. Stronger the foundation and the pillars, higher the construction can be.

## Mission & Vision - the foundational layer

The mission is the bedrock of any strategy. It defines the organization's purpose and the core reason for its existence.

The vision builds upon the mission. It outlines the desired future state that the organization seeks to achieve.

## Strategic Pillars - supporting structure

Strategic pillars are key focus areas that implement the long-term strategy, mission & vision. They are strong and flexible, each representing a fundamental component of the strategy.

Similar terms: strategic areas, strategic bets, levers

### Axioms:

* Strategic alignment â†’ strategic areas emerge from long-term strategy (mission, vision, values)
* Phase alignment â†’ strategic areas are aligned with the OSCâ€™s current stage of development â†’ on long term, strategic areas are fluid

## Goals (objectives)

Goals are specific, measurable outcomes that OSC aims to achieve. They are built based on the strategic pillars. There isnâ€™t a 1 to 1 relationship to Strategic Pillars, Goals may span several pillars, reflecting a cohesive approach to realizing the OS mission and vision. SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound) goals are a good choice.

\
Note: the terms objectives and goals are quite similar. We prefer to use goals due to the SMART goals framework

### Axioms:

* Alignment â†’ goals emerge from the Strategic Areas
* Prioritization â†’ goals are prioritized according to their impact on Long-Term Strategy
* Commitment â†’ committed goals receive full attention and funding
* SMART â†’ goals are defined in SMART framework
* Ownership â†’ each goal has an owner who is the key driver in make things moving forward

### Action items

Actions could include any plans, tools, and processes necessary to achieve the goals. They form the roof of the strategic edifice, completing the structure and ensuring that the house is fully operational and protected.

### Axioms:

* Alignment â†’ action items derives directly from goals â†’ the are the way the goals are driven to success
* Ownership â†’ each action item has an owner assigned. !! no proxy ownership !!
* Levels of granularity â†’ not all action items are equal â†’ they follow a granularity definition
* DoR, DoD â†’ no AI without clear DoR and DoD
* Backlogs â†’ OSâ€™ AIs are organized in backlogs (weâ€™d recommend Kanban boards)
* Tooling â†’ AI are managed and tracked in a specialized tool

## Values - nuts and bolts, keep everything together

Values are the non-negotiable core of an organization that influences all actions and strategies. They serve as a liaison that keeps everything together, with all components of strategy being true to OSOâ€™s identity and purpose.&#x20;

### Key characteristics

* Align decisions with the mission and vision
* Ensure that strategic pillars are pursued in a way that is true to the organization's identity
* Foster a strong organizational culture that guides goal setting and the execution of actions

### Long-Term Strategy

Long-term strategy is about setting a vision for the future and defining the mission and values that will guide the organization towards that future. It is aspirational and provides a sense of purpose. Itâ€™s about answering the questions like "What do we want to become? / What is our purpose?" and ensures all members of our community are aligned towards a common end-state. This strategy is less about the specifics of day-to-day operations and more about setting the direction for the years to come.

### Hands-On Strategy

Hands-on strategy, on the other hand, translates the mission, vision and values into more actionable steps. It is about the implementation of the long-term strategy through strategic pillars and goals that are more tangible. This is where the broad strokes of the long-term strategy are broken down into specific projects, initiatives, and metrics that will lead to the achievement of the long-term vision. Hands-on strategy is the response to a question like "What are the key focus areas to achieve the vision?", and it is more dynamic, evolving in response to challenges and opportunities.

### Operational Strategy

Operational strategy is the execution arm of Intersect-MBO, focusing on the day-to-day activities and processes that support the strategic goals and initiatives. It involves detailed planning of resources, operational processes, policies and performance metrics to ensure efficiency and effectiveness.. Operational strategy is concerned about "How do we operate efficiently on a daily basis to meet our strategic objectives?"
