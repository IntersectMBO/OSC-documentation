# ðŸ¤© Open Source Strategy

As Cardanoâ€™s journey in the Voltaire era continues, the Open Source Committeeâ€™s strategy empowers community-led and sustainability-driven decisions, shaping our path forward in open source development.

## **General Context**

The scope of this document is to present the Open Source Committee Cardano strategy. This strategy proposal is mainly defined by our strong commitment to a community-led and decentralized approach. The mission is clear: to support Cardano's journey in the open-source world, ensuring it remains both stable and secure.&#x20;

As Cardanoâ€™s journey in the Voltaire era continues, the Open Source Committeeâ€™s strategy empowers community-led and sustainability-driven decisions, shaping our path forward in open source development

The strategy for Cardanoâ€™s open-source development has been shaped through a collaborative effort, involving a diverse group of stakeholders. Starting with fundamental questions about our identity and who we serve, we established a clear mission, vision, and values that guided the next steps, and the more granular elements. This has been a deliberate, step-by-step process to ensure that the strategic objectives we set are not only a reflection of our collective ambitions but also actionable and measurable.

More details about the methodology used and the foundational model in the Appendix A.

## Summary

We envision Core Cardano as a project mainly defined by its technological excellence, driven by an inclusive community. Improving technical sustainability, governance, and deepening community engagement â€” these are the strategic pillars that sit in the middle of the structure and will guide our actions and goals for the current development stage.&#x20;

For example, by the end of 2024, we aim to complete a comprehensive audit of Intersect-maintained Cardano projects, according to a Project Lifecycle Framework. This initiative, alongside our commitment to diversified funding models and diversifying maintainers group, set the ground for positioning Cardano as a model of open-source execution.

The diagram below illustrates our strategy development process. From the core mission and vision, we have identified strategic pillars that are crucial to our success. They have been broken down into specific goals, supported by detailed actions that outline how we will accomplish them.

The strategic approach embedded in this framework is designed to be iterative, a living model open to constant refinement. It supports a dynamic strategy concept, where all our thinking and actions continuously evolve according to the market changes, maturity stages, and the needs of the Cardano community. That way we ensure our trajectory is both responsive and resilient.

## Strategy elements

### Mission

We enable the successful development and evolution of Cardano as a community-led, decentralized open source project

Our mission is to support the growth of Cardano into a community-driven, decentralized open-source project. We are committed to providing tools, policies and support for its success, ensuring it remains adaptable and accessible.&#x20;

### Vision

We envision a future where the Cardano project is strongly led by a thriving community, and its open development is not dominated by any single entity.

We want to see Cardano evolving in open-source mature initiative, driven by a strong and diverse community. We foresee a future where the project is known for both its technological excellence and its democratic, inclusive development process. Cardano will exemplify a decentralized but stable ecosystem where every contributor plays its part.&#x20;

### Core Values

#### **Openness**

We believe and promote transparent collaboration, accessibility, flexibility, and community-driven governance, fostering trust, inclusivity, and innovation in the Cardano Open Source Project (COSP).

COSP is more than a collection of GitHub repositories - it is the source code for the binaries that are deployed onto the real Cardano mainnet. It is therefore of the utmost importance to maintain the legitimacy of the COSP.

#### **Citizenship**

We are committed to be an exemplary Open Source citizen, actively contributing to the broader ecosystem and setting a standard in the open-source world.

#### **Quality**

We maintain the security and health of the Cardano mainnet. We are fully committed to high quality, both in decision-making and in writing software.

#### **Sustainability**

We acknowledge the necessity for ongoing development of the COSP, aiming to prevent stagnation and ensure the Cardano network's continued growth and dynamism.

### Strategic Pillars

#### Technical Sustainability

Ensuring Core Cardano maintains its reputation for being robust, secure, and open, while continuously adapting to new technological developments and environmental changes.

#### [Governance](https://intersect.gitbook.io/open-source-committee/policies/governance) and Decision-Making

We follow a transparent, inclusive, and effective governance model that empowers the Cardano community to actively participate in the decision making process.&#x20;

#### Community Engagement and Collaboration

We focus on contribution diversity, especially among maintainers, establish communication channels for collaboration, and empower community-led projects.

## Goals & Actions

#### Goal 1 - By Q4, 2024, all Intersect-maintained Cardano projects will have been audited and made decisions, based on the Project Lifecycle Framework, about their sustainability, risk mitigation strategy, and possible post-mortem actions (if applicable).

#### Metrics:

* 100% of the projects will audited
* 50% of projects will have a diversified funding model

#### Actions:

1. Establish the project lifecycle framework\
   This framework will include guidelines for project stages, key milestones, success metrics, risk indicators, intervention strategies, and post-mortem actions. Also a plan for continuously monitoring projects.
2. Evaluate projects according to the Lifecycle Framework\
   Through this assessment we want to understand projectsâ€™ current phase, health, and sustainability.&#x20;
3. Implement project support items\
   Project support actions will be established in association with framework and escalations for project health identified by assessment

#### Goal 2 - By Q4 2024 70% of Intersect-maintained projects will be aligned with the published Intersect Project Governance Policy by using open communications channels for discussions and meetings.

#### Metric:

* No of projects meeting the criteria â†’ 70%

#### Actions:

1. Stabilize the Governance Policy\
   Weâ€™ll conclude pilot testing the implementation of the Governance Policy, ensuring it's clear, comprehensive, and ready to be fully deployed across projects
2. Work with projects to help them implement the Governance Policy\
