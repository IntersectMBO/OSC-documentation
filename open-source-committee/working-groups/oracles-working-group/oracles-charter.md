1. Formalize Intersect Membership: Assoc or Founding Member
   * Mentioned in Intersect’s [Working Groups How To](https://drive.google.com/file/d/14GFD\_oDW7u5OLzSrN2gbDOEuyME9z0K8/view?usp=drive\_link)
2. Use the following content to complete [GitBook Template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1REqjkLgxZof8T0mQKTxa3IRlEaarnExroR2xihMCcRM/edit) in next meeting

## What is the problem that this working group seeks to address?

Despite blockchain oracles being a foundational component in decentralized software ecosystems, general disagreement as to what constitutes a blockchain oracle and how consumers or integrators should interface with their services pervades the Cardano ecosystem.

### Purpose / Goals

In order to address the above problem statement, this Intersect working group seeks the following:

* To Improve the quality of access to data for Cardano projects and their users
* To ascertain the needs of the user(s) of blockchain oracles
* To increase the awareness of blockchain oracles and their value
* To participate in the narrative around, Cardano native, blockchain oracles
* To increase the adoption and integration of blockchain oracle data

### Deliverables

The goals of this working group will be me through the following deliverables:

* smart contract interfaces (cardano/uplc)
  * Primary focus on modular consumption of data
* Develop best practices for off-chain architecture (e.g. bonding, …)
* Requirements
  * Solution-oriented business needs
  * Reference Implementation
  * Need to get prices
    * Of cardano native tokens
    * Of real world assets
    * Of other crypto assets (cross-chain)
* (Open) Standard
  * Best practices
  * Spec as code (datums, redeemers)
* Consensus
  * Glossary ([Intersect Glossary](https://github.com/IntersectMBO/glossary-intersect-all/tree/main))

## Governance

### Rules of order

The working group will utilize the simplified [Roberts Rules of Order](https://assembly.cornell.edu/sites/default/files/roberts\_rules\_simplified.pdf) in order to structure its meetings.Please find the simplified and condesed Roberts Rules of Order in the Oracles WG folder on the OSC Shared Drive.

## Membership

During these initial stages of the working group, membership will be simplified to voting and non-voting. At the acceptance of this document, all eligible members will be made voting members, with the following taking effect thereafter.

### Non-voting members

All working group meeting attendees who do not meet the eligibility requirements of voting membership.

### Voting members

Those who have attended 2 out of any 3 consecutive meetings will be recognized as voting members of this working group.\


Attendance will not be credited to an individual representative of a project but to the project itself; this is meant to give projects increased flexibility while maintaining their membership.

#### Representation

While we encourage projects to invite multiple members of their team to attend these working group meetings, only one representative can participate within the capacity of a voting member. This will ensure that no single project has more influence than others.

### Attendance

During the initial stages of this working group, member attendance will be tracked by hand. Preferably within meeting minutes and shared in the Intersect Discord channel.

#### Quorum

In order to meet quorum, working group meetings must have attendance from a simple majority of voting members. The number of voting members needed will be determined based on the attendance from the previous meeting.

### Who is the WG Lead?

The working group lead is a position held by a voting member, which has received both a nomination and vote from a simple majority of voting members. The position may only be held for 1 quarter before another nomination and vote is required.

During these early stages, the position of working group lead should be held by a voting member who is not actively developing a blockchain oracle.
