# Strategy Working Group

Goal
To come up with an initial strategy for Intersect projects.

The initial output should be as minimal as possible, but should cover:
Basic open source good practice, increasing utilization, and contribution of Cardano
Governance framework, 
General plan for it
Community Interaction
How community contributes
First iteration of Cardano Open Source Strategy
Strategy template provided by Modus
Must align with the OSC goals
Facilitate input and feedback from stakeholder groups
Revise iterations if applicable
Implement via pilots for UAT

Addressed by policy TWG: Some amount of "meta-policy"
Where policy should live
How changes should be made to it
What sort of things are in scope for policy; general principles

Since this is a working group, we should end up with an actual artifact representing our first policy draft.

Rough Plan:

Strategy Development

Brainstorming sessions with stakeholders to understand pain, goals, and needs.
Establish a clear set of deliverables for the working group.
Define the timeline for each stage of the strategy formation.

Documentation and Process Management

Decide on a platform or tool for collaborative editing and versioning.
Create guidelines on how changes can be proposed, reviewed, and approved.

Stakeholder Engagement

Regular meetings with the working groups.
Collect and prioritize feedback for integration into the strategy.
Maintain open channels for communication.

Benchmarking and Research

Deep dive into the governance structures and practices of foundations like CNCF, Linux Foundation, Apache, OpenStack, FinOS, Hyperledger.
Extract relevant insights and best practices.
Analyze potential pitfalls and how they can be avoided for Cardano.

Strategy Refinement

Iterative refinement based on feedback, research, and emerging insights.
Consider feedback from the pilot UAT when refining the strategy.

Finalization and Voting

Presentation of the refined strategy to OSC and key stakeholders.
Address feedback and concerns.
Voting process to adopt the strategy.
