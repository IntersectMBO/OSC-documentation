# Introduction

These pages contain policies that relate to open source at Intersect.

## Policy wording

The policies use [RFC-2119](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt) keywords to indicate the requirement level of various policies. We do not generally require capitalization of requirement keywords.

## Changing Policies

Policies are not set in stone, and anyone can propose a change to a policy: simply make a pull request to the repository.&#x20;

Changes must be approved by the OSC, but proposers should solicit community feedback before asking the OSC to approve.
