# Documentation

## Documents found in Intersect Open Source Repos

A project must contain the following documents:

* `README`
* `DESCRIPTION`
* `LICENSE`
* `CONTRIBUTING.md`
* `CODE_OF_CONDUCT`
* `CODEOWNERS.md`
* A `CHANGELOG` (if the project includes multiple packages or similar, then one `CHANGELOG` per package may be more appropriate)

## Other Items found in Intersect Open Source Repos

A project should contain the following documents:

* `RISSUE TEMPLATE`
* `PULL REQUEST (PR) TEMPLATE`

The documents should be easily accessible and discoverable, ideally by being put in standard locations.

The content of these documents is largely up to the project contributors, but we include some additional policies below In the following, when we say that a document should include information, this can either mean it includes it directly, or that it clearly links to where it can be found.
