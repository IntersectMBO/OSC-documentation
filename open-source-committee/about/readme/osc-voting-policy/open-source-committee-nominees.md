My experience in Open Source as a Developer, Core Contributor and Co-Maintainer go back almost 15 years.

I contributed to many different public projects and co-maintained one for several years while I was also one of the core contributors (https://github.com/AlchemyCMS/alchemy\_cms). I am experienced with OS workflows and I know Open Source is a lot about communication, people, and entails legal and compliance questions.
