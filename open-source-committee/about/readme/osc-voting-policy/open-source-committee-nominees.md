My experience in Open Source as a Developer, Core Contributor and Co-Maintainer go back almost 15 years.

I contributed to many different public projects and co-maintained one for several years while I was also one of the core contributors (https://github.com/AlchemyCMS/alchemy\_cms). I am experienced with OS workflows and I know Open Source is a lot about communication, people, and entails legal and compliance questions.

Core Maintainer at AsyncAPI Initiative&#x20;

I’ve been a Core Design Maintainer at the AsyncAPI Initiative for about three (3) years, where I also serve on the Technical Steering Committee (TSC). My responsibilities include managing design tasks, mentoring new designers, and leading projects like the AsyncAPI CONF on the Tour’23 website. I also played a key role in the Code of Conduct Committee, where I updated our CoC to reflect our commitment to inclusivity and diversity.

These experiences have honed my skills in maintaining high standards and fostering a collaborative, inclusive environment, aligning well with the OSC’s quality, legitimacy, and sustainability goals in open-source projects. I am eager to apply these skills to support and advance the OSC’s initiatives.

My experience in open source development and my roles as a Core Maintainer with the AsyncAPI Initiative and a member of the Technical Steering Committee(TSC) and Code of Conduct Committee (CoC) have prepared me to support the OSC’s mission effectively. I’ve focused on high-quality community engagement, inclusivity and sustainability.&#x20;

I look forward to collaborating with the committee to advance Intersect open-source initiatives.
