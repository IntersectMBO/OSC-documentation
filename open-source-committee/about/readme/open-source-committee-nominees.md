### Adam Dean

Open Source/OS Project Experience: 5+ Years

I have been a full stack developer, project/product manager, and consumer of open source projects since 2010. I joined the Cardano ecosystem and became enamored with the idea of contributing to open source in 2019. Since then I have endeavored to publish most of my projects under open source licenses and contribute and participate on open source projects whenever possible.&#x20;

### Marius Georgescu

Open Source/OS Project Experience: 0 - 1 Years

I became passionate about functional programming, particularly Haskell, after discovering it through the Cardano community. Over the past three years, I have been actively learning and working with Haskell, gaining approximately seven months of hands-on experience as a part-time developer. During the past year, I completed a successful Project Catalyst proposal (Project ID 1000064) for the development of a Cardano DApp, along with extensive documentation of the entire process.

Additionally, I graduated from the Emurgo Academy's Cardano Solutions Architect program, further deepening my understanding of the Cardano ecosystem. Although my journey as an open-source developer is still in its early stages, I intend to be deeply engaged with the Cardano open-source ecosystem and community.

### Brian Hughes

Open Source/OS Project Experience: 1 - 3 Years

I currently work for a company which publishes its own OSS variant of its enterprise product where I assist with all build, publish, and infrastructure decisions and some architectural decisions for the last 2+ years. We also contribute to multiple Apache projects. Before that I have always been an advocate for OSS my entire 15+ year career as a backend engineer.

### Johnny Kelly

Open Source/OS Project Experience: 0 - 1 Years

My level of experience is currently only at the level of End User Testing and the giving of UX/UI Feedback at present, but I have been following Cardano Node and the various other Software Projects of the Cardano Ecosystem's Development Work for multiple years now.

I have experience in single handedly writing PHP & SQL Query Code, as well as creating the backend SQL Tables, for my own Hobby Project over at atsusni.com, but work relating to this is currently on hiatus and the Code itself is in a Private GitHub Repository. The skills related to using Git for Commits and Pull Requests should be transferable however.

### Georg Link

Open Source/OS Project Experience: 5+ Years

**Diverse OS Experience:** I co-founded the Linux Foundation CHAOSS project, which standardizes how we measure open source community health. I have experience serving on the governing board, as well as growing and sustaining open source communities. I’ve made code and non-code contributions to several open source projects over the last 20 years.

**Building Thriving OS Communities:** My professional experience is 10+ years as an Open Source Strategist, having researched corporate engagement in open source and helping organizations adopt metrics and best practices. In my current job at Bitergia, I consult with organizations and open source communities across volunteer and for-profit open source. One of my focuses is on diversity, equity, and inclusion because making communities welcoming is the best way to get new contributors and keep existing ones.&#x20;

**Why me:** My background in growing thriving open source communities will be a valuable asset to Intersect’s Open Source Committee.

### Pedro Lucas

Open Source/OS Project Experience: 1 - 3 Years

I'm not a full-time dev, but I have over 20y experience in IT. Over the years I've valued OS more and more. Being in Cardano for almost 3 years, contacting daily with OS die hards like Gimbalabs, Mesh, BlinkLabs, has taught me a lot about the value of OS for an Ecosystem. Education and the community mindset can also be Open Source, actually I'd argue it starts there. We can say my focus is on the human side of OS, creating a two-way bridge between the OSC/OSO and 45B.io + CBIA.io.
