# OSC Engagement

### Meeting Minutes:

Minutes from each meeting are transcribed via Google Meet. They are reviewed and edited to align with proper speech and the relative conversation. Once complete it is passed through ChatGPT and formatted in a three-column table that highlights the Topic, Notes of what was discussed, and any applicable action items.&#x20;

Meeting Minutes are updated in the Active Notes file attached to the Meeting Invite and posted publicly in GitBooks. (Also viewable in GitHub with Sync)

### Meeting Agenda:

The agenda is discussed and set by the Committee Chair, Vice Chair, Secretary, and OSO Rep. Once the agenda has been set, a screenshot is added to the meeting invite, and is shared in the Discord and Slack channels.
