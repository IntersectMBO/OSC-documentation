# ðŸ“ˆ Current Monthly Maturity Report

## Summary

In June 2024, the Cardano open-source projects showed varied levels of activity and engagement across different metrics. The data suggests an overall increase in the number of commits and active repositories compared to May 2024, although the number of authors decreased slightly. Key highlights include:

* Commits: 1852 commits were made by 86 authors across 28 repositories, showing an increase from May's 1681 commits.
* Organizational Contributions: IOHK remained the top contributor with a slight increase in the number of commits. Also, new contributors emerged, indicating growing diversity in contributions.
* Geographic Distribution: Significant activity shifts were observed in different time zones, with notable increases in UTC+1 and UTC+3.
* Repository Activity: Increased activity was seen in several repositories, particularly govtool and plutus, with substantial changes in added lines and modified files.
* Issue Management: The number of issues increased slightly, with the average time issues remained open also rising, indicating potential areas for efficiency improvements in issue resolution.

## General Observations

Diversity and Engagement:

* The number of authors decreased slightly from 88 in May to 86 in June, while the number of active repositories increased from 26 to 28.&#x20;
* New contributors emerged, highlighting a positive trend to more diverse participation.

Organizational Contributions:

* IOHK continued to lead in contributions, with the number of commits increasing slightly from 896 in May to 915 in June. There was a huge rise in added and removed lines.
* Tweag's activity showed a slight increase in commits and a substantial rise in added and removed lines, indicating active development and refinement.

Geographic Trends:

* Significant increases in commits were observed from UTC+1 (from 182 to 295) and UTC+3 (from 90 to 210), indicating growing contributions from these regions.
* Decreases in activity from UTC+5 (dropping from 202 to 180) highlight regional variations in contributions.

Repository Dynamics:

* The govtool repository saw a notable increase in activity, with commits rising from 297 in May to 315 in June, and a substantial increase in added lines, suggesting concentrated efforts on significant updates.
* The Plutus repository experienced a significant increase in commits.

Issue Resolution:

* The number of issues increased from 412 in May to 450 in June, with the average time issues remained open rising from 5.478 days to 6.281 days. This indicates a potential need for improvements in the issue resolution process.

Conclusion

Overall, the data for May 2024 reflects a healthy and evolving open-source ecosystem within Cardano, with increased diversity in contributions, improved issue resolution efficiency, and ongoing development across various projects and regions. These trends align with the strategic goals of enhancing technical sustainability, governance, and community engagement.

## Strategic Alignment

The trends observed in June 2024 align well with the strategic goals and pillars set for the Cardano open-source projects:

1. Community Engagement and Collaboration:
   1. The slight increase in active repositories and the emergence of new contributors support the goal of enhancing community engagement and fostering diverse contributions.
   2. The increased activity in repositories like govtool and plutus reflects ongoing efforts to ensure the reliability and quality of key projects.
2. Technical Sustainability:
   1. The significant updates and restructuring efforts by IOHK align with the goal of maintaining a robust, secure, and adaptable codebase.
   2. The consistent activity in repositories reflects ongoing efforts to ensure the reliability and quality of key projects.
3. Governance and Decision-Making:
   1. The significant geographic distribution of contributions, particularly the increases from UTC+1 and UTC+3, supports the vision of a decentralized and community-led project.
   2. The need for improvements in issue resolution efficiency, as indicated by the rise in average time issues remaining open, aligns with the goal of establishing efficient and transparent processes for managing project health and community feedback.

Overall, the data for June 2024 reflects a healthy and evolving open-source ecosystem within Cardano, with increased diversity in contributions and ongoing development across various projects and regions. These trends support the strategic goals of enhancing technical sustainability, governance, and community engagement, positioning Cardano for continued growth and success in the open-source domain.
