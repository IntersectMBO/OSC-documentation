# ðŸ˜² Developer Advocate Program

As the Cardano ecosystem continues to expand and evolve, there is a growing need for dedicated support and advocacy to nurture developer talent, foster collaboration, and drive innovation. Intersect, a member-based organization within the Cardano ecosystem, recognizes the importance of engaging developers and empowering them to contribute effectively to the ecosystem's growth.

To address this need, Intersect has launched a Developer Advocate Program as an extension of its open-source office (OSO). This program aims to incentivize and support developers who actively participate in various initiatives, working groups, and community-building activities within the Cardano ecosystem. By compensating developers for their contributions and providing them with resources and opportunities, Intersect seeks to create a vibrant and thriving developer community within Cardano.

Developer Advocate candidates were given 30 days to apply in June-July 2024. Interviews were completed shortly thereafter and 4 Developer Advocates have been selected. They are:
